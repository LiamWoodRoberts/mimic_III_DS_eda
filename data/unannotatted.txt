Mg sulfate 2 g IV x1, azithromycin 500 mg IVx1, levofloxacin 750 mg IVx1, and Cefrtiaxone 1g IVx1
Patient became tachpnic so was trialed on non-invasive ventilation but became hypotensive to systolics of 80, so noninvasive was removed and patient did well on NRB and nebulizers for about 2 hours
At that time patient became agitated, hypoxic to 87% and tachypnic to the 40s, so patient was intubated
Post intubation ABG was 7
3/60/88/31

In  11-16  he had elective cath showing 90% restenosis at proximal edge of previously placed stent, treated with overlapping Cyper stent
Mid-RCA was 80% occluded and treated with DES as well
In  2-18  pt had a left femoral artery to dorsalis pedis artery bypass graft with an in situ greater saphenous vein graft
His plavix was discontinued at that time
He was recently admitted on  2188-4-30  w/ STEMI over III, F, taken to cath, where he had a DES placed in the LCX for the vessel being occluded by a thrombus proximally
Of note, at cath  4-30 , he had a totally occluded right external iliac artery
The pt was discharged home  2188-5-3 
Since that time, per the pt, he felt at baseline, with the exception of intermittent left leg pain  s/p vascular surgery, bypass  that would occasionally awaken him at night
He stated he was up this morning at 4am b/c of this left leg pain, when he developed a "cold rough" feeling in his esophagus similar to his pain that he had with all of his prior MIs
He states it was a  5-24  in severity
He took 1 nitro, and it resolved
He reports he did not take his plavix yesterday and today
He noted intermittent right sided chest pain as well last night, which felt like "gas pain", + SOB, no diaphoresis, + nausea, no vomiting
He states the feeling returned and then persisted, took a 2nd nitro but it only decreased the pain to a  2192-2-16 
He called 911

His pain, however, only resolved completely on nitro gtt at OSH where he was given ASA, IV integrillin, IV heparin, started on nitro drip with full resolution of pain, transferred to  Hospital1 18  for emergent cath
His initial BP at OSH 130/75, down to 93/63 after nitro
Outside labs with CK 60, other ezymes pending at time of transfer, BNP 17
At  Hospital1 18 , he was given plavix 600mg load prior to cath
In the cath lab LCX was totally occluded within proximal stents
A wire was passed and flow was reestablished  likely development of blood clots 
1 additional bare metal stent  no DES since he had questionable compliance w/ plavix  placed distal to last stent
Some non-occluding stenosis in the distal branches
Cath was performed via radial artery  per lower ext arterial disease 
His right groin  femoral vein  developed a hematoma
His left groin was not accessed given his c/o left leg pain post surgery 2 months ago
He was subsequently transferred to the floor
He then had BP drop to 90s/40s-50s and a pm HCT was found to be 27
7  6 point drop from pre-cath HCT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS 86y M with PMH significant for HTN, CAD s/p CABG, afib  now on warfarin , stroke 2y ago, and a seizure disorder on Keppra  previously seen in clinic by Dr
Last Name  STitle  619 
atrial fibrillation on Coumadin
who presents with left ear pain
He presented to the OSH ED   Hospital1  - Location  un  620   1wk PTA with CC ear pain
He was sent home with Dx of cerumen in external canal
His ear pain continued and this past Friday his PCP prescribed  Name9  PRE  621  gtt for presumed otitis externa
Per his son, he developed progressive confusion and imbalance
He became unable to walk, and became more somnolent
He returned to the ED at  Hospital1  - Location  un  620  in the evening of  2158-2-13   1d prior to transfer here , where his VS were notable for fever to 102
2F  after arriving afebrile  and tachycardia  normalized with 1
5 L IVF , and exam was notable for somnolence
His WBC was elevated at 14
INR was 3
Dig 0
Troponin negative
UA "negative" and CBC/BMP/LFTs reportedly unremarkable/wnl
A NCHCT showed Left mastoiditis
He was given a dose of IV Zosyn
ENT was consulted, and recommended admission for surgical Tx the following morning and switching to CTX  2gm IV  for mastoiditis Tx
He was given his evening dose of warfarin after clearance from ENT, with a plan for ENT surgery and ID consultation in the morning
However, around 600am the morning after admission   2157-2-14  , the patient had a GTC seizure requiring 12mg IV lorazepam to stop
He was loaded with 1gm of IV phenytoin and his levetiracitam was increased to 1500mg  Hospital1    from his home dose of 750mg  Hospital1   
He was intubated and maintained on a propofol gtt on and off
His post-ictal exam was notable for spontaneous movements of all four extremities, but lack of eye opening/arousability
A Neurologist there saw the patient, but his notes are not immediately available to me
His HCT was repeated after the seizure, and a very tiny focus of hemorrhage  hyperintensity  was seen at the posterior end of the Left lateral ventricle  ~trigone 
There was also also a call of hyperintensity in the interpeduncular fossa  which would, if true, suggest subarachnoid blood, but on reviewing the images I think this is an overcall 
Finally, there was a large hypodensity in the Right temporal lobe, which looks old, and could be the "old stroke" seen on MRI in  2156  on OSH workup in  State 622  for his only previous GTC seizure  see PMH, below 
The OSH physicians thought he may have hemorrhagic conversion of an acute stroke in the Right temporal lobe  despite a lack of any evidence for this on the NCHCT , and held his warfarin, which was a good idea anyway because he had a supratherapeutic INR at the time of 3
After discussing the case with a Neurologist here at  Hospital1 18 , they decided to hold off on reversing his coagulopathy with vitamin K or FFP
They continued his statin
Regarding his infectious and other general medical workup/treatment, he had  4-17  BCx bottles return positive for GPC in pairs
The cultures were repeated post-antibiotics
A TTE was obtained out of concern for septic cerebral embolus, and it did not show valvular vegitations, but did show several thickened/diseased valves
TEE was considered, but not done
He was given a couple liters of IVF for decreased urine output  and urine was dark on arrival here 
He was continued on his digoxin  level y/d was 0
86 , and his home BB and CCB were held
He was doing just find on MV/CMV with ABG of 7
39/35/174 and an unremarkable CXR
They did not start tube feeds

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS 62 year old female with chronic low back pain s/p multiple lumbar surgeries presents for elective anterior/posterior decompression laminectomy on  2179-5-25 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient is a 74-year-old female with increased shortness of breath and chest pain with exertion x 2 weeks
She went to an outside hospital and was transferred here to  Hospital1 69  for catheterization
The patient had right CA stent placed in  2188 
Cardiac catheterization showed 90% left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis, 90% diagonal stenosis, 90% circumflex stenosis and 80% right coronary artery stenosis
Ejection fraction was roughly 68%
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  This is a 75-year-old female patient who had a very prolonged previous hospitalization at the  Hospital1 69  and was ultimately discharged on  2195-5-28 
During her hospitalization, she underwent coronary artery bypass graft x4 with an aortic valve replacement
Her postoperative course was complicated by aspiration, wound infection of her sternal wound as well as of her saphenectomy, gastrostomy tube placement, followed by necrosis of the abdominal wall as well as acute renal failure
Please see discharge summary from that hospitalization for details of her postoperative course after her cardiac surgery
The patient was readmitted to the hospital on  2195-6-6  due to fevers to 103 at the rehabilitation facility despite being on intravenous antibiotics
In the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to have a fair amount of purulent drainage in the open sternal wound
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at that time
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient is a 75-year-old female, status post a long hospitalization at  Hospital1 18  culminating in CABG x 4, porcine AVR, aspiration, infection, sternal wound infection, saphenous vein site infection, status post a G-tube with abdominal wall necrosis, status post J-tube, ARF requiring hemodialysis
The patient eventually discharged on  2195-5-28 
Then readmitted on  2195-6-6  for fever to 103
In VICU for sternal wound infection and transferred to  Hospital   Rehab
At  Hospital1  , two days prior to admission per report, the patient had a PEA arrest, status post epinephrine
The patient went into V-fib arrest, status post 100 mg joule shock which converted into A-fib
The patient was transferred to  Hospital 8  Hospital late PM on  2195-6-28 
The patient there was continued on vent
Chest x-ray and CT showed a bilateral lower lobe consolidation and left upper lobe consolidation
The  Year  4 digits    report from  Hospital 8  Hospital attributed mucous plugging and vent associated pneumonia leading to PEA arrest
Also contributing were elements of hyperkalemia, hypoxia and hypovolemia
The patient had initially had episodes of SVT in the 70s-90s which responded to 250 of normal saline
The patient remained in atrial fibrillation and spontaneously converted to sinus
She was transferred to  Hospital1 18  for continuity of care
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient is a 75 year old female with an extremely complicated past medical history including coronary artery bypass graft times four, atrial ventricular valve replacement in  1-12 , and a precipitously difficult postoperative course
The patient has never been weaned from her ventilator and has had multiple ventilator associated pneumonias, particularly most recently with pseudomonas Serratia and Klebsiella
The patient has end stage renal disease and history of gastrointestinal bleed secondary to gastritis and esophagitis
Most recently, the patient was discharged from this hospital to rehabilitation in early  Month  only  547  only to come back with fevers and ultimately grew out Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus wound infection requiring debridement on  2195-5-28 
The patient returned to rehabilitation  2195-6-22 , where she sustained a pulmonary embolus arrest, received Epinephrine and electrical conversion
The patient was noted to have decreased responsiveness post code attributed to anoxic brain injury per neurology
She was transferred back to  Hospital   Rehabilitation where she underwent vigorous physical therapy
On  2195-8-1 , per family she had a fever of 103 with culture peripherally and from her dialysis catheter
Both grew out Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
The patient was started on a course of Vancomycin with only low grade temperature
She became lethargic on  2195-8-9 , and was unable to tolerate hemodialysis due to hypotension, systolic blood pressure in the 70s
The patient briefly improved postdialysis on  2195-8-10 , as did her mental status, but then became increasingly lethargic with heart beats in the 130s, blood pressure 80 over palpable, and was transferred over to  Hospital1 69  for further management
On arrival, the patient was noted to be extremely febrile, hypotensive, tachypneic
The patient received an A line and right internal jugular central line for monitoring and fluid resuscitation
The patient's course was complicated by her poor toleration of hemodialysis secondary to hypotension and was started on pressors of Levophed and ultimately required an addition of vasopressor
The patient was becoming increasingly somnolent and had not defervesced at this time despite the addition of multiple antibiotic therapy, Flagyl, Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, and Tobramycin
CT of the abdomen and chest showed no frank abscess or fluid collection
Flagyl was ultimately discontinued as decreased probability of anaerobic infection
Cultures at outside hospital showed multidrug resistant organisms including Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
Transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained to rule out endocarditis and it was negative showing ejection fraction of 55%
Left Hickman catheter with  Hospital1   as probable source of infection
Foley was placed at this time
The patient was anuric yet 10cc of purulent material was noted
The patient was now growing gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters from two different sites, the Hickman and/or previous PICC line
She was increasing her pressor requirement and was hypotensive despite two liters of fluid
She was started on Dopamine in addition to her Levophed and vasopressors
Throughout the day, the patient's systolic blood pressure decreased to the 80/30
By  2195-8-14 , she was back on EC vent control
The patient was noted at 343 a
on  2195-8-15 , to have an episode of asystole
The family was at bedside as well throughout the night
The pupils were noted to be fixed and dilated and unresponsive
Ventilation was discontinued and spontaneous respirations were not observed
The patient was declared dead at 343 a
The family declined autopsy

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  This is a 53-year-old gentleman who went to see his primary care physician for his yearly physical
At that time, he reported a 1-year history of burning substernal chest pain with exertion
He underwent an exercise treadmill test which was positive and subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization which showed an ejection fraction of 55%, 90% left main coronary artery, 90% proximal left anterior descending artery, 60% to 80% left circumflex, and a proximally occluded right coronary artery
The patient was referred to Dr
Last Name  STitle  1537  for urgent coronary artery bypass grafting
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  This is a 64-year-old man with an extensive cardiac history including coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction times two, status post multiple interventions, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction less than 20%, ventricular tachycardia, status post AICD placement in  2157 , who presented to the Emergency Department after syncopal episodes and AICD firing
The patient noted three days prior to admission, feeling of palpitations especially when lying down for bed
On the day of admission, the patient became lightheaded a while, bending down to tie his shoes and felt some palpitations
He then felt a shock from his ICD
He, thereafter, awoke on the floor
Over the course of the day, he had three more episodes, a feeling of palpitations, and lightheadedness followed by a shock and then losing consciousness
In the Emergency Department, the patient was observed to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia consistent with atrial fibrillation in the setting of his underlying left bundle branch block
While in the Emergency Department, he developed transient regular wide complex tachycardia to approximately 170 beats per minute
His ICD fired during this rhythm and was subsequently degenerated into a ventricular fibrillation, prompting the ICD to fire again, recovering the rhythm back to atrial fibrillation
An amiodarone load was begun and the patient appeared to spontaneously convert to sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block
The ICD settings were increased while the patient was in the Emergency Department so that the first shock administered was increased from 12 to 24 joules
The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for continued intravenous amiodarone loading and further evaluation
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  This is a 64-year-old man with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy who presents with five days of shortness of breath
He developed the shortness of breath in the setting of cough, lethargy and subjective fevers
He presents to the Emergency Room where he was found to be significant dyspneic
Physical examination revealed evidence of pulmonary edema and a chest x-ray showed bilateral infiltrates
His oxygen saturation was 86% on room air
His ABG was 7
54, 48, 27
He was given supplemental oxygen and 60 mg of IV Lasix with a good response and his oxygen saturation increased to 90% on three liters
He was admitted to the cardiac floor with a diagnosis of a CHF exacerbation
About one hour after arriving on the floor, about five hours after presentation, he was found to be acutely hypoxic with an oxygen saturation in the low 80's despite being on 100% non rebreather
EKG showed possible inferior ST elevations in the setting of a paced left bundle branch block
He continued to be hypoxic despite an additional 200 mg IV of Lasix, Heparin and a Nitro drip
For this reason he was emergently intubated and transferred to the CCU
On arrival to the CCU he was noted to have a temperature of 103
His heart rate was increased and his blood pressure was low
His urine output dropped off
He was started on Dopamine and his Nitro drip was stopped
He was also started on Vanco, Levo and Flagyl
As he defervesced, his vital signs stabilized and he began to have normal urine output again

He initially received morphine and ativan without relief and then received 5mg IV metoprolol and IV nitroglycerine with relief
On 12
20, patient found to have troponin I with 83
41 and was transferred to  Hospital1 18  for cardiac catheterization
At cardiac cath, patient found to have the following 3 vessel native coronary artery disease; LMCA 50% distal in-stent restenosis; LAD occluded proximally; LCX 60% at its origin with occluded OM branches except for OM3 which was occluded distally; RCA known to be occluded and not selectively engaged; LIMA-LAD widely patent to distal LAD
SVG-RCA was known to be occluded and was not engaged selectively
The SVG-D-OM had an ulcerated 80% stenosis at the diagnoal origin and widely patent OM stent
Patient had a drug eluting stent placed  Cypher 3
5 x 18  to the SVG-Diag-OM
170cc dye used during procedure and hemodynamics not performed  Aortic pressure 145/74 with HR 73 
Post cath course complicated by development of acute shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and respiratory distress, thought likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema
Patient started on a NRB and received 60mg furosemide IV total  20 then 40 , morphine 5mg, and was started on a nitro drip for elevated blood pressures to SBPs to 190s
Upon arrival to the floor, patient was started on BiPap but had persistent respiratory distress with use of accessory muscles and increased CO2 retention, as seen on ABG  7
29 / 59 / 160

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Mr
Known lastname 5314  is a 75 yo male with h/o CHF and CAD s/p CABG who presented to presented on  10-4  to  Hospital3 3583  with a complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath
Patient is intubated at time of transfer to  Hospital1 18 , and history was obtained almost entirely from discharge summary
At time of admission to  Hospital3 3583 , he described sudden onset of sharp left-sided chest pain, with onset at rest
On arrival to the ED, he reported shortness of breat and was found to have SpO2 84% on room air
He was placed on a nonrebreather and was subsequently intubated in the ED for respiratory failure
The patient was treated with lasix and responded with good UOP and improvement of his respiratory status
ABG performed 90 minutes after intubation was 7
18/72/86
Known lastname 5314  was subseqnetly admitted to the CCC at  Hospital1 3325  where he was started on standing IV lasix, Nitro paste 1" q8h, an insulin drip and Propofol for sedation
Anti-hypertensives were held, but he was continued on ASA, Plavix, and Lipitor
Patient was felt to be septic due to an episode of hypotension with a fever to 101 and a leukocytosis of 17
Patient was reported to be maintaining BP's of 100/60 with Vasopressin, Levophed, and IVF boluses
He underwent an TTE which showed mid to distal hypokinetic areas of the LV and a hypokinetic apex, moderate MR, and an EF of 15-20%, which is notably diminished from an EF of 40-60% two weeks prior
Of note, patient was admitted to  Hospital3 3583  from  Date range  1  5316  with a similar presentation; at that time elevated troponins were felt to be related to his renal insufficiency
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Ms
Known lastname 5320  is a 72 y/o female with a history of HCV, metastatic HCC that is not amenable to treatment, who initially presented to the ER with altered mental status since last night
Her daughters say that starting yesterday she was much more sleepy, not wanting to get up, they also said that she had been coughing and having nasal congestion
She was not eating or drinking much, only a few small sips of water
This morning she was not really waking up much, so they called 911

Review of systems  +  Per HPI
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Patient is a 77F who had a primary left total hip replacement in  2152  by another surgeon that sustained progressive protrusio early, ultimately failing with loss of fixation of the acetabulum
I brought  Known firstname 5321  to surgery a little over a year ago at which time we felt that her best treatment option intraoperatively would be allograft packing of the acetabulum defect and a hemiarthroplasty head
Also considered at the time was a Restoration GAP prosthesis
She did well for probably 10 or 12 months and then started developing pain and x-rays demonstrated progressive protrusio with the femoral head at risk for pushing through the remnant of the acetabulum
We have also seen insufficiency fractures developing on the pubic ramus and in the posterior wall of the acetabulum
The patient is developing progressive pain, unrelenting, and sciatic symptoms
She has been made nonweightbearing a couple months ago in preparation for the surgery
She understands this is very much a salvage operation
She is developing progressive fracturing from osteoporosis and there is very little bone stock remaining
She is really not a candidate for major allograft pelvic reconstruction as fixation would be limited
Best treatment course, cemented GAP cage and avoidance of further allograft
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  78F has had abd distension x 1 week
She says she has not thrown up but her pcp's note from yesterday says she has
She has been moving her bowels
For the past two days she has felt weak and had diffuse abd pain
She had a loose bms early yesterday

She had initially presented with a colonic perforation due to erosion from a L hip prosthesis, and underwent a Hartmann's procedure  sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy 
She then required an emergent R-->L Fem-Fem bypass for acute LLE ischemia
The hip was treated with sequential washouts and hardware removal
Her post-operative course was extensive, but notable for GI bleeding presenting as falling anemia, for which an EGD showed mild esophagitis managed with  Hospital1   protonix
A colonoscopy through the stoma was unsuccessful because the stoma had sloughed and retracted below the skin level
She also developed CHF and hypothyroidism managed with diuretics and synthroid, respectively
Wound issues included minor wound infection at the midline incision managed with wet-to-dry, a VAC at the L hip changed serially in the OR and later at the bedside, and mild breakdown at the Fem-Fem bypass site treated with betadine swabs
She was finally discharged on  2164-6-12  on a prolonged course of Zosyn, Daptomycin, and Fluconazole via a PICC

Today he was scheduled for LUL fiducial electrode placement and was noted to have relative hypotension with  Name  NI  5462  in the 90's
His primary oncologist noted L > R weakness on examination and neurology was consulted out of concern for potential stroke
The patient dates the onset of worsening generalized weakness and gait instability for the last 2 months, similar to around the time he was diagnosed with LUL mass
The patient complains of decreased PO intake and DOE, unchanged from recent baseline
He may have had one episode of dysuria today but denies urinary frequency
He denies fevers, chills, headache, chest pain, SOB at rest, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgias, myalgias, rash

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient is a 58 year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease status post four vessel coronary artery bypass graft in  2106  who underwent evaluation of chest and upper arm discomfort times several weeks
In addition the patient was also experiencing exertional chest pain and dyspnea on exertion after one flight of stairs
On  2115-1-10  the patient underwent an ETT thallium and exercise for seven minutes by  Doctor First Name   protocol with chest pain, but no significant EKG changes on a normal thallium study
The patient was admitted to the CMI Service on  2115-2-7  and underwent coronary catheterization that same day
During this catheterization LV gram revealed a sustained ejection fraction at 60% with evidence of a 70% proximal and 50% mid stenosis of the SVT to PDA graft and a 30% proximal stenosis of the SVG to OM2 graft as well as a 99% proximal stenosis of the SVG to D1 graft
The patient underwent PTCA and stent placement with no residual stenosis of the SVG to D1 graft on the 8th with no complications at that time
Notably the patient also was with a patent LIMA to LAD graft during his first catheterization
On the  2-8  the patient returned to the catheterization laboratory  and underwent a percu-surge device procedure for the SVG to PDA lesion
Notably this artery had diffuse disease proximally with 80% ulcerated stenosis and 40% mid stenosis
The patient underwent PTCA and stent with observation of TIMI-2 fast flow
This procedure was complicated by evidence of distal embolization of the plaque during the procedure
Hemodynamic monitoring at this catheterization revealed RA pressure of 7, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 7, cardiac index of 2
5 with a patent SVG to D1 stent
The patient was kept on Integrilin with a goal of 48 hours total therapy secondary to his complicated catheterization
Several hours after his second cath on  2-8 , the patient had an acute drop in his systolic blood pressures to the 70's
He responded with elevation of pressures after 500 cc IV fluid bolus
Telemetry also showed three episodes of five beat nonsustained ventricular tachycardia
On the morning of   the 10th the patient was complaining of pleuritic chest pain and mild shortness of breath
CKs at this time were checked and were notably rising compared to the prior day
EKG at this time revealed ST segment elevation of 
5 to 1 mm in lead 3, AVF and precordial lead V2 to V4 ST depressions
Later in the evening the patient continued to have constant chest pain associated only with shortness of breath
The pain improved in the semi-upright position, however, the patient had minimal relief with increasing of an IV nitroglycerin drip or morphine
After consultation of the interventional cardiology fellow it was believed that the patient was likely having a subacute myocardial infarction as indicated by ischemic changes on EKG and persistent chest discomfort post cath in the setting of a complicated catheterization with evidence of distal embolization
It was the impression of the staff interventional cardiologist that the patient was not suitable to take back to the catheterization laboratory, since there was no suitable therapy for small vessel distal embolization
The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit at this time for hemodynamic monitoring and for close observation

She was admitted to Medicine due to medical comorbidity
Surgery was initally planned for  2131-10-16  but on that day, she developed hypoxemia and cyanosis and CXR showed pulmonary edema, so she was diuresed with Lasix and Bumex and she did well though her O2 sats remained in the high 90??????s on 2-3LNC
Cardiology and Pulmonary were consulted
Pulmonary felt, that she likely has interstitial underlying lung disease as well that is contributing to her hypoxemia
Duonebs were given

There was mediastinal and hilar adenopathy
The decision was made to diurese further, and her oxygen requirement was decreased from 3L to 1L nc
She had a repeat UA which showed E
coli that was sensitive to bactrim, so the zosyn was changed to bactrim
On  10-24  she was felt stable to go to the OR the following day for possible surgical repair of both hips
On  10-25  she was taken to the OR and the left hip repair was started
She was noted to have a large amount of bleeding, and an intraopeartive hct was 21%  from 30% the previous day 
She was given 3u PRBC intraoperatively
She was noted to have an arrhythmia vs ST depressions on telemetry during this time
The decision was made to not proceed with the right hip at this time
There was a postoperative attempt at extubation, which per report she failed due to rising CO2

The patient states that he was in his usual state of health when he woke up this morning  10-2 
He was in his kitchen when the next thing he knew he woke up on the floor
He denies any prodrome including dizziness, lightheadedness, vertigo, focal weakness, or aura
He does not know how long he was unconscious, but when he awoke he was experiencing acute onset  10-8  retrosternal chest pain
The pain was diffuse and located at the midline
It was not positional and was not acutely associated with nausea or vomiting
It did radiate up to his jaw, which alarmed him since this was exactly what he experienced when he had his MI
He does not think he fell on his chest
He was able to get up on his own, climb the stairs, and call EMS
He was brought to  Hospital3   where he was given ASA and nitro SL without relief of his chest pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Mr
Known lastname 3315  is a 76 year old male with chronic diastolic congestive heart failure aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation  and chronic atrial fibrillation who presented to outside hospital with progressive shortness of breath and chest pain for the last six months
He admits to occasional rest pain as well
During that admission, he was found to be anemic and transfused with several units of PRBC's
Endoscopy found a nonbleeding AV malformation in the proximal duodenum
Given his above cardiac status, he was transferred to the  Hospital1 18  for further evaluation and treatment
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS 81y/o M with h/o diverticular bleed presented to ED with melena and BRBPR x1 day
Pt felt lightheaded, but denied CP, palpitations, or dyspnea at rest
+ DOE
Denied N/V
Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on ED exam
Hct had dropped from 41
9 in  7-14  to 33
NG lavage was performed, which revealed active bleeding that did not clear - 1000cc lavage was performed
Pt was noted to have ST depressions in V2-V3 and elevated troponin to 0
Pt was transfused 5 units PRBCs
EGD revealed esophageal varices and active bleeding
Banding was attempted but unsuccessful
Profuse bleeding was noted during EGD, and pt had episodes of frank hematemesis
He was therefore intubated and sedated
In the  Name  NI   , pt rec'd 6 units PRBC and 5 units FFP  INR 2

Varices did not fill with injection of dye into the portal vein
TIPS was not performed
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Dr
Known lastname 3339  is a 60 yoM with a history of myxomatous mitral valve disease s/p annuloplasty ' 98 , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation currently on Dronedarone and Coumadin, h/o postoperative NSVT s/p ICD placement, and h/o nondilated cardiomyopathy with EF  who presents with lightheadedness and near-syncope in the context of recent undefined illness and weight loss
Pt reports history of 25lb weight loss in the past 6 weeks that he attributes to losing his sense of taste due to his Parkinson's meds
He denies any further focal symptoms during this time frame
Then, today he was not feeling well while at work in the ED here at  Hospital1 18 
He had been feeling lightheaded all day
He went home then relates that he was laying on the couch watching TV with his daughter and may have passed out for some time, the only thing he remembers is his daughter waking him up
He is unsure if he actually lost consciousness or not
A family member took his pulse and found him to be in the 20's, so brought him to the ED
There his vitals were hr 31, 110/68, 18, 100% RA
He was found to have elevated INR, hypokalemic and repleted
EKG showing sinus bradycardia with intermittent ventricular escape beats and Vpaced beats
He is admitted to CCU for pacer interrogation and monitoring
ROS is positive as above and also with worsening postural hypoTN, which he ascribes to the Parkinson's meds, and lost of taste, also attributed to Parkinson's meds 
ROS is negative for f/c/ns, CP, SOB, diaphoresis, cough, PND, orthopnea, syncope
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient is a 78 year-old male admitted earlier then anticipated, because of failure to thrive, respiratory difficulties, peripheral edema and pericardial effusion after having been discharged for a prior hospitalization for aspiration pneumonia where he was found to have a collapse of his left main stem bronchus, distal trachea and right main stem bronchus for which he subsequently had a stent placed during that previous visit
He returned on  4-23  of  2195  earlier then anticipated as mentioned previously for removal of these stents and tracheoplasty and pericardiotomy for intraoperative pericardiotomy for pericardial effusion that he developed
At the time of his admission the patient was afebrile with blood pressure 150/80, pulse 70, respiratory rate 20 and he was sating 95% on room air
Notably on examination his cardiac examination revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm
The lungs revealed bilateral crackles throughout and there was 1 to 2+ pitting edema most markedly notable in the lower extremities
On admission his electrolytes were all within normal limits with a BUN and creatinine of 18 and 1
His white blood cell count was 4
Hematocrit 37
5 and platelet count was 131
PT was 13
7, INR 1
2 and PTT was 59
The patient was admitted and had his stents removed on  4-28 
He subsequently underwent a number of bronchoscopies for clearing of secretions
He was optimized preoperatively for surgery
On  4-30  he underwent right thoracotomy with posterior membrane tracheoplasty and bilateral bronchoplasties along with pericardial window
The surgery went smoothly without complications, but due to the patient's size and anatomy the distal portion of the left main stem bronchus could not be corrected, therefore some tracheomalacia remained at that edge
Initially postoperatively, the patient's course went fairly smoothly
Several days postoperatively the patient developed acute renal failure for which his creatinine jumped to 3
5 and this was found to be partially due to acute tubular necrosis and hypovolemia
The patient remained in and out of atrial fibrillation throughout the course of his hospitalization
One week postoperatively the patient went into pulmonary congestion and subsequent respiratory arrest at which time he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, but was subsequently extubated with aggressive diuresis and aggressive antimicrobial therapy
The patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit after his tracheal bronchitis had cleared and he subsequently went back to the floor
While on the floor the patient developed severe pneumonia, which required him to return to the Intensive Care Unit
Again with aggressive care and antimicrobial therapy he regained enough strength to return to the floor
After discharge to the floor toward the end of his hospitalization he did well for two weeks
He did have repeat bronchoscopies, which showed the distal tracheal malacia as previously mentioned, but there was excellent clearance of secretions throughout
It is anticipated that as his airway edema resolves his clearance will become even more improved
Of note, late in his hospital course the patient developed recurrent right pleural effusions with some loculations, but the majority of this was cleared with placement of a chest tube

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Age over 90  yo man with h/o Parkinson's disease, multiple prior admissions for aspiration pneumonia most recently  2142-4-23 , who presents again from  Hospital 100  Rehab after the staff there had "trouble waking him up" this AM, and found him to be in mixed respiratory failure
On the prior admit, the pt was diagnosed with a LLL pna and treated with vancomycin/zosyn
Per his wife, the patient was doing relatively well last week, still in the MACU at  Hospital 100  Rehab since his recent discharge from  Hospital1 18  but with a plan to transition to the regular floor soon
His ABG on  2142-5-16  was 7
34/69/55 on room air, which is close to his baseline pCO2
On Saturday 2d PTA, the pt's wife noted that he was congested more than baseline, initially unable to cough, but then improved after neb treatments with the production of brown-pink secretions
He had hyperglycemia to FS 223, which per wife he has never had before  no h/o DM 
By Saturday night though he was doing well, less congested and speaking clearly
Then, Sunday AM, he was congested again and though he received nebs he was not able to cough out the secretions
Per the Pulmonologist note from Sunday PM, he was then found to be poorly arousable, with RR 30, shallow breathing, lungs clear, O2 sat 90% on pulse oximeter
ABG performed, 7
20/107/44, O2 sat 68% on ABG, presumably on room air though unclear
BIPAP was written for  IPAP 16, EPAP 3 , though it is not clear if this was started
He was shortly thereafter intubated after the Pulmonologist confirmed his Full Code status with the pt's wife
After intubation, it was noted that he had copious thick yellow secretions in his trachea, which were felt to be the culprit causing obstruction and hypercarbia/hypoxemia
With suctioning his breathing improved, and he was transferred to  Hospital1 18  for further work up
The patient remained awake the whole time
He was noted to have a temp of 100
4F this AM
Upon arrival to the  Hospital1 18  ED, he appeared to be in no respiratory distress
His initial ABG was 7
34/67/315
He was found to be febrile to 100
4F, with HR 60s-70s, SBPs ranged 60s-80s
His CXR was concerning to the ED staff for RUL/RLL processes  though appears to have only persistent LLL , and he was given CTX, Vanc, and Flagyl out of concern for nosocomial vs
aspiration pna
His urine was leuk esterase  +  on UA, culture pending
Blood cultures were also sent
He received 1L NS for hypotension, and subsequently his pressures were still low so he was started on a dopamine drip via a newly-placed RIJ  per report, sterile placement via ultrasound in the ER 
He also had a 18G PIV placed, and has a PICC line from  Hospital   Rehab that is of unclear age or indication  felt to be from prior need for IV abx 
His ECG was notable for Q-wave in V1, ST elevations laterally, concerning for ischemia
TnT 0
